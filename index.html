    	<h1>The Case against FAANG</h1>
		<p>Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google -- and don't forget Palantir</p>
		<br>
		<p>This page contains links to articles, tweets and other online resoures outlining all that is wrong with Big Tech. I started this list as I found myself continuously reading horrible things about the big companies within my field and I felt like the information was worth sharing.</p>
		<p>At the end of the page, there is a list of books I would recommend both about tech and society in general.</p>
		<p>And just FYI. This is not a smear-campaign or something I have written without thinking about the good that these companies are also doing like connecting people, making buying and selling goods easier, sharing information and ideas etc.. I am a software engineer. I know this. And it is because I know this and a little more on the intricacies of the technologies that are out there that I want to voice my skepticism. Maybe at some point this was about the user, but for these companies today, the user is the product we are sold at a profit without even knowing to whom or for what price. This is not democratic. This is not making the world a better place. This is pitting us against each other in the fight for our attention and our money. This is creating and serving controversial content exactly because this is what makes us engange -- no matter how wrong or harmful the content is. We can do better -- and doing so is easier on an informed basis.</p>
		<p><i>This page is maintained by me at the rate I have capacity for. The basic flow is: I read something horrible yet credible and I add it. If you would like to contribute, please reach out. Help is always appreciated.</i></p>

			<h2>Suggested books</h2>
			<p><i>For some of the books, rather than linking to a page where you can buy it, I am linking to a Wikipedia page instead. Read more about it. If you like it, buy it anywhere, but please consider chosing someone other than Amazon.</i></p>

			<p>To some, this might seem like a little mix of everything, and maybe it is. For me, these books together show how big corporations avoid legislation, undermine worker's rights and democracy in the pursuit of eternal growth and maximal profit (which is impossible on a planet with limited resources). </p>
			<p>The books show how tech-schauvinism is creating a surveillance society at a profit while eroding and ruining our lives right before our eyes. It's a tough realization, but knowing this is needed if we want to change (which we desperately do!).</p>
