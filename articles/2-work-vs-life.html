			<h1>Work vs Life</h1>

			<p>You have to work full time and keep your free time for learning about topics within your domain (or lie
				about to seem dedicated)</p>
			<p>All positions are full time</p>
			<p>Compensation is bad</p>
			<p>Working conditions are bad</p>
			<p>Your employer is too demanding -- to those claiming the younger generations don't handle challenges very
				well, fuck off, we are working harder in a more competitive environment than you ever did. </p>
			<p>It is not our problem that you chose to work in a toxic environment without saying anything for the last
				30 years -- however we want something better for ourselves, we are not demanding asking too much, we
				want what's fair. You sucking up to your employer by saying something that makes them happy is not
				making anything better for either one of us. So what side do you really want to be on?</p>
