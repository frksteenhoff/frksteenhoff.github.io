			<h2>Crime data from San Fransisco Police Department</h2>
			<p>This page documents the two exercises in Assignment 2 in the course 02806 - Social Data Analysis, spring semester 2017. The data used for visualization is gathered from <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/" target="_blank">San Fransisco OpenData</a> and is used for learning purposes working with data driven visualizations in D3.</p>

			<h3>Visualization 2A - One scatter plot, two datasets</h3>
			<p>The plot below visualizes the total number of crimes commited for the crime types "Prostitution" and "Vehicle Theft" in San Fransisco. The interactive visualization enables the user to toggle between the crime data for years 2003 and 2015 by clicking on the button above the plot. By using the year currently displayed (2003) as example, how to understand the graph and what results can be extracted from it will be explained.</p>
			<br></br>
			<button type="button_small" id=year_toggle><p3>Click here to toggle between data from 2003 and 2015</p3></button>
			
			<!-- The script with data for the plot -->
			<center><div id="scatter_crime"></div></center>

			<br></br>
			<p>The sizes of the different circles associated with each district gives the relative size of the number of crimes commited as a fraction of the total number of crimes.</p>
			<p>As described by the axes, the height and width indicates the sum of Vehicle Theft and Prostitution. The higher/farther you move away from Origo, the more crimes of both types are commited. This means that district like Mission and Northern both have a relative high number of both Prostitution and Vehicle Thefts, whereas Tenderloin has a relative high number of Prostitution cases, but not that many Vehicle Thefts. A general trend that can be deduced from this visualization is the fact that most district have close to zero Prostitution cases, but a relative high number of Vehicle Thefts. The district with the smallest number of Vehicle Thefts in 2015 is Tenderloin, while the smallest number of Prostitution Crimes is Park.</p>
			<p>Since the scales are fixed, just looking at the transition between the two year give a pretty good idea of what has happened. Comparing the two years, it can easily be seen that the number of both crime types has fallen significantly from 2003 to 2015. Prostitution has almost been completely out-phased -- notice how Northern, Mission and Tenderloin all take huge leaps to the left and Ingleside and Bayview move downwards all while the circle radii decreases. The least changes are seen in the distric that already had low crime rates, i.e Park, Richmond and Central. </p>
			<br></br>
			
			<p><strong>Why keep axes fixed?</strong></p>
			<p>Even though we have learned how to scale the axis according to each input dataset, this is not always the most approporiate way to visualize data. It is smart if you have randomly generated data which can vary a lot in range, but since we are trying to make a comparison between to different years, it will be easier to say something informative about the difference if we weigh the two years on an "equal scale".</p> 
			<p>When the axes have a fixes size, it is easier to compare the different values, as the scaling won't center in and fit onto just one set of data. This way, when toggling through the two sets of values it is really easy to be able to say something about the number of crimes both as a whole and individually.</p>

				<h3>Visualization 2B - geodata</h3>
				<p>The following plot shows the geo locations of all crimes commited of type Prostitution in San Fransisco for the years 2003-2016. The basic plot shows the 'epicenters' of Prostitution when two clusters are generated based on all given locations. By clicking on the buttons below the plot, you can change the number of clusters -- data is available for at most 6 clusters. This visualization is made from the results from the <strong>K</strong>-means exercise from week 5.</p> 
				<p>The related iPython Notebook for extracting the data material can be found in the repo, or by following <a href="https://github.com/frksteenhoff/frksteenhoff.github.io/blob/a03d1bc2faef936dcc2c14b3917e79b57ec204f0/Assignment2/dataprep.ipynb" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Each cluster is colored with a unique color to easier separate the different groups. Some opacity is added to each point such that the intensity of the color can aid in understanding whether certain areas within the different clusters are more exposed to Prostitution than others. Investigating the map, it is easy to see that most Prostitution is reported in Northern, Tenderloin (located south of Northern almost completely covered in dots) and Mission. This is also the trend shown in the previous figure from Assignment 2A. Adding the map gives an extra layer to the information that can be retrieved from the data. Now it is also possible to say something about what geographic locations in San Fransisco Prostitution most frequently occur. Lookng at SF as a square it is no doubt the upper east part that is most exposed. Remember that the different clusters to not take the districts into account. They merely show the groupings of data points where the color indicates the associated cluster. Thus, it might not fully resemble the actual number of crimes in each district or make different clusters for each district. For instance Northern and Tenderloin are both within the same cluster -- at least when choosing two clusters, but this is because of their closeness geographically. </p>
				<p><strong>geojson file size</strong></p>
				<p>Having a large file makes the retrieval of data for the visualizations slower. This means that transitions between different datasets might take longer and the loading of data might not seem as smooth or worse, might be missing! Therefore, creating a data structure that is more compact -- containing more information using less space is preferred. We ended up with a file size of ~3MB which is still quite large and can with no doubt be improved.</p>
